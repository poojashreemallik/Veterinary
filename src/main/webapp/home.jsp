	<i><b> Motivation :</b></i><br/><br/>
In this digital age, we have an opportunity to transform lives of people in ways that was hard to imagine just a couple of decades ago.
We must ensure that technology is accessible, affordable and adds value.Technology is a tool that bridges the distance between the rural and the city. 
The farmers are the backbone of our country, so if we use the latest technology to help farmers then,it will in-turn help the nation to bridge the digital divide.
The main problem for people living in remote place or rural areas is consulting veterinary doctors in time.
Whenever the animals fall ill or suffer from rare contagious diseases then it becomes tough for those people in rural areas to take preliminary measures.
So we are coming up with an app called <b>Online Veterinary Aid</b> which will enable farmers to get expert medical advice and consult vets who may be based remotely.
